<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Joseph, a central figure in the Book of Genesis, was the beloved son of Jacob and Rachel. Favored by his father, he received a coat of many colors, which sparked jealousy among his brothers. They sold him into slavery, and he was taken to Egypt, where he was bought by Potiphar. Despite facing hardships, including false accusations and imprisonment, Joseph remained faithful to God. His ability to interpret dreams led him to Pharaoh, where he correctly predicted seven years of abundance followed by seven years of famine. Pharaoh appointed him as Egypt’s second-in-command, overseeing grain storage and distribution.

  During the famine, Joseph’s brothers unknowingly sought food from him, leading to a dramatic and emotional reunion. After testing their character, he revealed his identity, forgave them, and invited his family to settle in Egypt. His story highlights themes of faith, resilience, forgiveness, and divine providence, showing how God can turn suffering into blessing. Joseph’s legacy continued as the Israelites multiplied in Egypt, setting the stage for the Exodus led by Moses.
